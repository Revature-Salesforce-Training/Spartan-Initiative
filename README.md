**APERTURE , est. 2533, is part of the Helghast federation and is licensed by the Board of Scientific Research. We manufacture humanoid robots for use in security and military operations, as well as domestic applications. Our products range from small-scale scouts which can be deployed in groups to perform reconnaissance on enemy positions or act as first responders during emergencies, to larger-scale industrial models designed for heavy duty work in manufacturing and construction.**

**Dragons are cool, but they're not real. They don't exist. Unicorns aren't real either. But Droids... Droids are a way of life.**
